### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The largest help in terms of labwork, would have to be lab 3, as that focused on API calls as well as parsing json data. These two topics were crucial for this project.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would implement tidier CSS for my modal element, and change all of the fonts on my website, as everything is currently using the default font. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Everything went well with my demo, all of the core features were displayed properly, one setch feature, the embeded youtube video, failed, but I consider that to be an acceptable loss. Something that caught my eye was that one of my peers implemented a light mode/dark mode button.
